# soee - Google Tag Manager

Easily integrates Google Tag Manager installation code with your Neos website. 

## Installation

Add manually `soee-googletagmanager` package to your `composer.json` file to type in command line:

`composer install soee-googletagmanager`

## Configuration

By default Google Tag Manager codes are rendered only if you have identifier set through configuration:
```yaml
Soee:
  GoogleTagManager:
    identifier: 'MY-GOOGLETAGMANAGER-IDENTIFIER'
```

## Customizations

The whole process and integration code is highly customizable. This package defines 2 new nodetypes: 

`Soee.GoogleTagManager:Code` - used to render Google Tag Manager code inside head section
`Soee.GoogleTagManager:NoscriptCode` - used to render noscript Google Tag Manager code after body opening tag

Both [Code](Resources/Private/Fusion/Prototypes/Code.fusion) and [NoscriptCode](Resources/Private/Fusion/Prototypes/NoscriptCode.fusion) inherit 
from `Neos.Fusion:Tag` so you can check current code and customize it as you will.

**Important:**

You probably do not want to render Google Tag Manager codes inside development or testing environment. This package will
help you with that but to do so we are checking `Flow` context name like this:

```fusion
@if.inProductionEnvironment = ${Configuration.setting('Neos.Flow.core.context') == 'Production' ? true:false}
```

While this should work just fine in most cases it is still recommended to use your own variable that defines current
environment. For example if your site package name is `Vendor.Site` than you could create 2 `Settings.yaml` files:
one would be `Configuration\Production\Settings.yaml` and second `Configuration\Development\Settings.yaml` (similar 
for any extra environment). Than inside this 2 files you can configure environment configuration option:

for **Production** it could be:

```yaml
Vendor:
  Site:
    environment: 'Production'
```

for **Development** it could be:

```yaml
Vendor:
  Site:
    environment: 'Development'
```

Than you can use it decide if Google Tag Manager code should be rendered like this:
```Fusion
Neos.Neos:Page {
  ...
  googleTagManagerCode {
    @if.inProductionEnvironment = ${Configuration.setting('Vendor.Site.environment') == 'Production' ? true:false}
  }
  ...
  googleTagManagerNoscriptCode {
    @if.inProductionEnvironment = ${Configuration.setting('Vendor.Site.environment') == 'Production' ? true:false}
  }
  ...
}
```
